Description
===========

OSeMOSYS tools for energy work, or otoole, is a Python package
to support the users of OSeMOSYS. The aim of the package is to provide commonly
used pre- and post-processing steps for OSeMOSYS.

**otoole** aims to support different ways of storing input data and results,
including csv files and Excel workbooks, as well as different implementations
of the OSeMOSYS model. This improves interoperability of analyses and
generally makes life a little bit easier.
