  abstract = {This paper discusses the design and development of the Open Source Energy Modeling System (OSeMOSYS). It describes the model's formulation in terms of a `plain English' description, algebraic formulation, implementation\textemdash in terms of its full source code, as well as a detailed description of the model inputs, parameters, and outputs. A key feature of the OSeMOSYS implementation is that it is contained in less than five pages of documented, easily accessible code. Other existing energy system models that do not have this emphasis on compactness and openness makes the barrier to entry by new users much higher, as well as making the addition of innovative new functionality very difficult. The paper begins by describing the rationale for the development of OSeMOSYS and its structure. The current preliminary implementation of the model is then demonstrated for a discrete example. Next, we explain how new development efforts will build on the existing OSeMOSYS codebase. The paper closes with thoughts regarding the organization of the OSeMOSYS community, associated capacity development efforts, and linkages to other open source efforts including adding functionality to the LEAP model.},

  abstract = {Background: Energy system optimisation models (ESOMs) are commonly used to support long-term planning at national, regional, or continental scales. The importance of recognising uncertainty in energy system modelling is regularly commented on but there is little practical guidance on how to best incorporate existing techniques, such as global sensitivity analysis, despite some good applications in the literature. Methods: In this paper, we provide comprehensive guidelines for conducting a global sensitivity analysis of an ESOM, aiming to remove barriers to adopting this approach. With a pedagogical intent, we begin by exploring why you should conduct a global sensitivity analysis. We then describe how to implement a global sensitivity analysis using the Morris method in an ESOM using a sequence of simple illustrative models built using the Open Source energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS) framework, followed by a realistic example. Results: Results show that the global sensitivity analysis identifies influential parameters that drive results in the simple and realistic models, and identifies uninfluential parameters which can be ignored or fixed. We show that global sensitivity analysis can be applied to ESOMs with relative ease using freely available open-source tools. The results replicate the findings of best-practice studies from the field demonstrating the importance of including all parameters in the analysis and avoiding a narrow focus on particular parameters such as technology costs. Conclusions: The results highlight the benefits of performing a global sensitivity analysis for the design of energy system optimisation scenarios. We discuss how the results can be interpreted and used to enhance the transparency and rigour of energy system modelling studies.},

  abstract = {The areas of energy, water and food policy have numerous interwoven concerns ranging from ensuring access to services, to environmental impacts to price volatility. These issues manifest in very different ways in each of the three ``spheres'', but often the impacts are closely related. Identifying these interrelationships a priori is of great importance to help target synergies and avoid potential tensions. Systems thinking is required to address such a wide swath of possible topics. This paper briefly describes some of the linkages at a high-level of aggregation \textendash{} primarily from a developing country perspective \textendash{} and via case studies, to arrive at some promising directions for addressing the nexus. To that end, we also present the attributes of a modelling framework that specifically addresses the nexus, and can thus serve to inform more effective national policies and regulations. While environmental issues are normally the `cohesive principle' from which the three areas are considered jointly, the enormous inequalities arising from a lack of access suggest that economic and security-related issues may be stronger motivators of change. Finally, consideration of the complex interactions will require new institutional capacity both in industrialised and developing countries.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces the design and implementation of two parallel dual simplex solvers for general large scale sparse linear programming problems. One approach, called PAMI, extends a relatively unknown pivoting strategy called suboptimization and exploits parallelism across multiple iterations. The other, called SIP, exploits purely single iteration parallelism by overlapping computational components when possible. Computational results show that the performance of PAMI is superior to that of the leading open-source simplex solver, and that SIP complements PAMI in achieving speedup when PAMI results in slowdown. One of the authors has implemented the techniques underlying PAMI within the FICO Xpress simplex solver and this paper presents computational results demonstrating their value. In developing the first parallel revised simplex solver of general utility, this work represents a significant achievement in computational optimization.},

Overall, these three pillars show how a community of practice can be built around an open source tool and provides an example for other developers and users of open source software wanting to build a community of practice.},

    abstract = {Historically, energy system tools were predominantly proprietary and not shared with others. In recent years, there has been an increase in developing open source tools by international research and development organizations. More than half of the open energy modeling (openmod) initiative listed tools are based on the freely available scripting language Python. Previous comparisons of energy and power system modeling tools focused on comparisons such as which tool category (e.g. optimization, simulation) or energy demand (e.g. electricity, cooling, and heating) can be considered. Until now, the assessment of incorporated functions such as unit commitment (UC) or optimum power flow (OPF) has been ignored. Therefore, this work assesses 31 mostly open source tools based on 81 functions for their maturity. The result shows that available open source tools such as Switch, TEMOA, OSeMOSYS, and pyPSA are mature enough based on a function comparison with commercial or proprietary tools for serious use. Nevertheless, future commercial, as well as open source energy system analysis tools, have to consider more functions such as the impact of ambient air conditions and part-load behavior to allow better assessments of including high shares or renewable energy sources and other flexibility measures in existing and new energy systems.},
