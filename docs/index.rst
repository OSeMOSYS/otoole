Welcome to the documentation of ``otoole``!
===========================================

**otoole**, or **O**\ SeMOSYS **tool**\ s for **e**\ nergy work, is a Python package
which provides a command-line interface and Python API for users of OSeMOSYS. The aim of the
package is to provide commonly used pre- and post-processing steps when working with OSeMOSYS models.
Specifically, ``otoole`` allows the user to convert between data formats, process solutions,
and visualise the reference energy system.

Currently, ``otoole`` only supports the GNU MathProg version of OSeMOSYS. We hope to build
support for other implementations of OSeMOSYS soon. In fact, this is one of the key aims
of ``otoole`` - to better link the various OSeMOSYS communities and their implementations
through common data standards and useful scripts and tools that we can work on together.
