==================
Core Functionality
==================

``otoole``'s functionality includes converting between data formats, processing
solution files, and visualising the model. These core functions, which provide a method
to turbo-charge your modelling, are described on this page!

As shown in the diagram, ``otoole`` deals primarily with data before and after OSeMOSYS.
Data work prior to the generation of a datafile, which is read in by GLPK_, is called
pre-processing. Anything that happens with the immediate outputs of a solver, such as
the recommended open-source solvers GLPK_, CBC_, or the proprietary solvers CPLEX_ and
Gurobi_, is called results and post-processing.

.. NOTE::
    While ``otoole`` is targeted at OSeMOSYS users, the functionality can easily be extended
    to work with any workflow that involves the use of a MathProg file!

Data Conversion
---------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~

``otoole`` supports different data pre-processing conversions so as to ease the tasks of
the OSeMOSYS modeller. The modeller can generate data in any one of the formats and
convert it to another format through a ``convert`` command. ``otoole`` currently supports
conversion between the following formats:

- Excel
- A folder of CSV files
- GNU MathProg datafile

``otoole convert``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``otoole convert``` command allows you to convert between various different
input formats::

    $ otoole convert --help
    usage: otoole convert [-h] [--write_defaults] {csv,datafile,excel} {csv,datafile,excel} from_path to_path config

    positional arguments:
    {csv,datafile,excel}  Input data format to convert from
    {csv,datafile,excel}  Input data format to convert to
    from_path             Path to file or folder to convert from
    to_path               Path to file or folder to convert to
    config                Path to config YAML file

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --write_defaults      Writes default values
    --keep_whitespace     Keeps leading/trailing whitespace

.. deprecated:: v1.0.0
    The ``datapackage`` format is no longer supported

.. versionadded:: v1.0.0
    The ``config`` positional argument is now required

Result Processing
-----------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~

With small OSeMOSYS models, it is normally fine to use the free open-source GLPK_ solver.
If you do, then OSeMOSYS will write out a full set of results as a folder of CSV files.
As you progress to larger models, the performance constraints of GLPK_ quickly become
apparent. CBC_ is an alternative open-source solver which offers better performance than
GLPK_ and can handle much larger models. However, CBC_ has no way of knowing how to write
out the CSV files you were used to dealing with when using GLPK_. ``otoole`` to the rescue!

``otoole`` currently supports using GLPK_, CBC_, CPLEX_ or Gurobi_ with all versions of
GNU MathProg OSeMOSYS - the long, short and fast versions.

The long version includes all results as variables within the formulation, so the
``otoole results`` command parses the solution file, extracts the required variables,
and produces a folder of CSV files containing the results in an identical format
to if you had used GLPK_.

The short and fast versions omit a large number of these calculated result variables
so as to speed up the model matrix generation and solution times.

``otoole results``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``results`` command creates a folder of CSV result files from a GLPK_, CBC_, CLP_,
Gurobi_ or CPLEX_ solution file together with the input data::

    $ otoole results --help
    usage: otoole results [-h] [--glpk_model GLPK_MODEL] [--write_defaults]
                        {cbc,cplex,gurobi} {csv} from_path to_path {csv,datafile,excel} input_path config

    positional arguments:
    {cbc,cplex,glpk,gurobi}  Result data format to convert from
    {csv}                    Result data format to convert to
    from_path                Path to file or folder to convert from
    to_path                  Path to file or folder to convert to
    {csv,datafile,excel}     Input data format
    input_path               Path to input_data
    config                   Path to config YAML file

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help                show this help message and exit
    --glpk_model GLPK_MODEL   GLPK model file required for processing GLPK results
    --write_defaults          Writes default values

.. versionadded:: v1.0.0
    The ``config`` positional argument is now required

.. versionadded:: v1.1.0
    The ``input_data_format`` and ``input_path`` positional arguments are now required
    supporting any supported format of input data for results processing.

.. deprecated:: v1.0.0
    The ``--input_datapackage`` flag is no longer supported

.. deprecated:: v1.1.0
    The ``--input_datapackage`` and ``--input_datafile`` flags
    have been replaced by new positional arguments ``input_data_format`` and ``input_path``

.. WARNING::
    If using CPLEX_, you will need to transform and sort the solution file before
    processing it with ``otoole``. Instructions on how to run the transformation
    script are on the `OSeMOSYS Repository`_. After transformation, sort the file
    with the command ``sort <solution_file> > <sorted_file>``.

Setup
-----
The ``setup`` module in ``otoole`` allows you to generate template files to
quickly get up and running.

``otoole setup``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``setup`` command allows you to generate a template user configuration file,
useful for ``conversion`` and ``result`` commands, and template input ``csv``
data::

    $ otoole setup --help

    usage: otoole setup [-h] [--write_defaults] [--overwrite] {config,csv} data_path

    positional arguments:
    {config,csv}      Type of file to setup
    data_path         Path to file or folder to save to

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help        show this help message and exit
    --write_defaults  Writes default values
    --overwrite       Overwrites existing data

.. WARNING::
    The template files are generated based on a specific version of OSeMOSYS, users will
    need to adapt the template data for their own needs

Visualization
-------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~
The visualization module in ``otoole`` allows you to visualise the reference energy system.
(with more visualisations to come!)

``otoole viz``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``viz`` command allows you to visualise aspects of the model. Currently, only
visualising the reference energy system through the ``vis res`` command is supported::

    $ otoole viz res --help

    usage: otoole viz res [-h] {csv,datafile,excel} data_path resfile config

    positional arguments:
    {csv,datafile,excel}  Input data format
    data_path             Input data path
    resfile               Path to reference energy system
    config                Path to config YAML file

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit

.. NOTE::
    The ``resfile`` command should include a file ending used for images,
    including ``bmp``, ``jpg``, ``pdf``, ``png`` etc. The graphviz_ library
    used to layout the reference energy system will interpret the file ending.

Validation
----------
The validation module in ``otoole`` checks technology and fuel names against a
standard or user defined configuration file.

``otoole validate``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``validate`` command allows you to identify any incorrectly named technologies
or fuels, by comparing against a user defined validation configuration file.
Moreover, ``otoole`` will check if any technology or fuel are unconnected from
the rest of the model::

    $ otoole validate --help

    usage: otoole validate [-h] [--validate_config VALIDATE_CONFIG] {csv,datafile,excel} data_file user_config

    positional arguments:
    {csv,datafile,excel}  Input data format
    data_file             Path to the OSeMOSYS data file to validate
    user_config           Path to config YAML file

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --validate_config VALIDATE_CONFIG
                            Path to a user-defined validation-config file
